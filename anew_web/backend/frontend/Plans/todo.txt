{To Do}

- Possibly torrent plugins to download for free
- Download netflix movies and give them away for free on this website and make money from ads
- Phishing website? 
- Replace the jp-play-bar, jp-progress and jp-seek-bar Ads
 * Static and Dynamic 
- Put the about page, terms and conditions, contact info/page and social medias in the footer
 * Contact page for the data models
  ** Possibly an SQL Workbench backend
- Put Mp3 Files in the download link and the audio tag for listener play back.
 * Cut audio loops to around 10 seconds 
  ** place the full Wav file in the download link 
   *** I ran the media root in the settings.py file and mapped the javascript to the html audio tag to the directory with the wav file.
    (I also tried putting the javascript in a script tag at the bottom of the html page. Also directly under the audio html tag)
    **** The wav file still isn't playing. 
     ***** Maybe I can recheck the MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL in the settings.py file and make sure it is correct
